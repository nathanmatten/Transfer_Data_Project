# Data Loading and Wrangling
## Data Loading
### Transfer Players dataframe
```{r Data Loading, cache = TRUE}
transfer_players <- transfer_portal(year = 2017) %>% 
  rbind(transfer_portal(year = 2018)) %>% 
  rbind(transfer_portal(year = 2019)) %>%

  rbind(transfer_portal(year = 2021)) %>% 
  rbind(transfer_portal(year = 2022)) %>% 
  select(-source) %>% 
  filter(from_d1 == TRUE, to_d1 == TRUE)
# Removed players that transferred to and from outside D1 -- I don't believe they're part of our study currently (but they can definitely be added back in)... although this removes about 900 player transfers
```
### Player stats dataframe
```{r Player Stats, cache = TRUE}
